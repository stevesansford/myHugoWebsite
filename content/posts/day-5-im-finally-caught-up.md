I missed my morning session today. Thanks to the late-night session yesterday where I tried to figure out [how to build a website with Hugo](/posts/day-4-i-got-sidetracked-by-hugo/). I believe it was successful, and even though I have much more to explore (and now I'm interested in Go), I'm satisfied with its current state.

I also missed my evening session as I'm cramming several days of blog posts into one day so I can get caught up. As I've mentioned in several previous posts, this idea for the **#100DaysOfCoding** challenge occurred to me four days into [my Python coding journey](/posts/day-1-laying-the-groundwork/). I hadn't been taking notes or setting up repositories, or really tracking my progress in any way.

There was much work to do to get caught up. Tomorrow, I'll get back into my proper coding schedule. I want to finish the next module in my [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) course. I'm working on basic algorithms by creating a shortest-path script.

I also want to spend some time on a couple of short (or one longer) copy-coding tutorials on YouTube. They're not the [best way to learn to code](http://localhost:1313/posts/day-2-coding-tutorials-vs-actually-coding/), but I do get enough value from them for the time invested.

I did manage to listen to a couple of interesting videos today. The first was a 90-second video on [how to keep coding enjoyable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hU_z9X4Kk). The premise was to set small goals and consistently reach them. An interesting approach. 

Even a small program can be hundreds of lines of code. Breaking that up into a series of small wins would be advantageous. Instead of grinding for hours and maybe celebrating a completed program, set a goal to write a single function for that script in the next 30 minutes. Celebrate when it's done. Move on to the next brick in the wall. 

The second video was from [Fireship on a development roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk), where he used an iceberg analogy to show the history of programming languages. It was interesting to hear about the development of the most popular languages and some of the more eccentric ones. 

I wonder if I can knock out a few Project Euler challenges [with Emojicode](https://www.emojicode.org/)?

Maybe we'll find out in 95 days...
